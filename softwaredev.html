                <p1>I am very interested in User Interface Design, so I have been playing around with websites, and will be starting a new web-development project soon, starting from scratch. I also like to learn about iOS development in my free time, as I am learning the Swift language, and learning how to use XCode. My practice is through clean code that is easily readable. I believe that this is key in organization, teamwork, and efficiency in software development.</p1>

                <p1>One of the projects I worked on was building this website. I started with almost no knowledge of HTML or CSS, and went through a few tutorials and built this website. I figured that it was a good place where I could experiment with simple web development technologies, and eventually add more advanced pieces to it.</p1>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p1>My family owns a small restaurant in Wolfeboro, NH, called the Downtown Grille Cafe. Through what I had learned through building my own website, I decided I could create a website for the coffee-side of the restaurant. Right now, it is in the process of adding content, but I have created the framework for the website so it is almost finished. Through this, I could eventually add in online ordering, email, and other areas that could be useful for this small business.</p1>

                <p1>Another area of interest for me has been iOS development. Unfortunately, with school and work, I have been unable to set aside a substantial amount of time and attention, but I hope to soon. I am very interested what the future holds with wearable technologies, and believe that this is an area where I can be a pioneer in development for Apple's upcoming technologies.<p1>
