				<p1>As a third-year student at Northeastern University, I am studying Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. Throughout high school and into college, I have always been extremely interested in new technologies and innovations. With my studies at Northeastern and my Co-op experiences, I have the goal to learn as much as I can to become a strong Software Developer.

				<p1>I have had the opportunity to be involved with IT for quite a few years, specifically with my work at Brewster Academy. Throughout my time there, I grew my desire to have an impact on people by connecting with them and helping them. While I will be going into Software Development, I strive to continue to grow this passion through my desire to work with many different areas such as database management, UI development, and more.
				</p1>

				<p1>During my last Co-op, I had the opportunity to work with the Personal Insurance ETL Development team at Liberty Mutual Insurance in Boston. I was able to learn enterprise-level data warehousing technologies such as Teradata and Informatica, as well as growing my foundation in UNIX and experimenting with Big Data applications.
